# lc - line counter
_lc_ is small utility for counting lines and words of a file. Heavily inspired
by wc. Created to help me further my skills in Rust and because I found it
annoying that wc did not tell you which number corresponded to the line count.

Please do critique the code as I cannot (yet!) claim to be very proficient at
Rust.
